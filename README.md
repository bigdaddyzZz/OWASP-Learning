# OWASP-Learning
This is a collection of the information that I've recorded while learning OWAP from scratch. I'll be using the wiki for recording information, and GitHub for hosting images and source files that I create. I will try to remember to give credit when I learn something from someone else, and always link to thier information.

I know that it has to be said, but this information is for research purposes. This is not a tutorial on "l337 haxing skills", it's purely for my reference and whould be treated as such. At the end of the day, `YOU are responsible for the things you do with the knowledge you gain`.
